Saving Parameters Using Pickle
If you want to save the camera calibration parameters to a file, you can use a package like Pickle to do it. It will encode these parameters into a text file that you can later upload into a program.

The three key parameters you want to make sure to save are mtx, dist, and optimal_camera_matrix.

Here is a list of some tutorials on how to use Pickle:

Datacamp 
Python Central
TutorialsPoint
Assuming you have import pickle at the top of your program, the Python code for saving the parameters to a pickle file would be as follows:

### Save the camera calibration results.
```
calib_result_pickle = {}
calib_result_pickle["mtx"] = mtx
calib_result_pickle["optimal_camera_matrix"] = optimal_camera_matrix
calib_result_pickle["dist"] = dist
calib_result_pickle["rvecs"] = rvecs
calib_result_pickle["tvecs"] = tvecs
pickle.dump(calib_result_pickle, open("camera_calib_pickle.p", "wb" ))
```

Then if at a later time, you wanted to load the parameters into a new program, you would use this code:

```
calib_result_pickle = pickle.load(open("camera_calib_pickle.p", "rb" ))
mtx = calib_result_pickle["mtx"]
optimal_camera_matrix = calib_result_pickle["optimal_camera_matrix"]
dist = calib_result_pickle["dist"]
Then, given an input image or video frame (i.e. distorted_image), we can undistort it using the following lines of code:
```
```
undistorted_image = cv2.undistort(distorted_image, mtx, dist, None, 
                                    optimal_camera_matrix)
```

Thatâ€™s it for this tutorial. Hope you enjoyed it. Now you know how to calibrate a camera using OpenCV.
