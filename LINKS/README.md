### ndt_omp

https://github.com/dfki-ric/pclomp

Multi-threaded and SSE friendly NDT algorithm

This package provides an OpenMP-boosted Normal Distributions Transform (and GICP) algorithm derived from pcl. The NDT algorithm is modified to be SSE-friendly and multi-threaded. It can run up to 10 times faster than its original version in pcl.
