### ndt_omp

https://github.com/dfki-ric/pclomp

Multi-threaded and SSE friendly NDT algorithm

This package provides an OpenMP-boosted Normal Distributions Transform (and GICP) algorithm derived from pcl. The NDT algorithm is modified to be SSE-friendly and multi-threaded. It can run up to 10 times faster than its original version in pcl.

### mycobot_ros2
OS ROS_2

This repository contains ROS 2 packages for simulating and controlling the myCobot robotic arm using ROS 2 Control and MoveIt 2. It provides support for Gazebo simulation and visualization in RViz. Gazebo simulation also includes simulated 3D point cloud data from the depth camera (RGBD) sensor plugin for vision.

### Navigation Plugins

https://docs.nav2.org/plugins/index.html


There are a number of plugin interfaces for users to create their own custom applications or algorithms with. Namely, the costmap layer, planner, controller, behavior tree, and behavior plugins. A list of all known plugins are listed here below for ROS 2 Navigation. If you know of a plugin, or you have created a new plugin, please consider submitting a pull request with that information.

This file can be found and edited under sphinx_docs/plugins/index.rst. For tutorials on creating your own plugins, please see Writing a New Costmap2D Plugin, Writing a New Behavior Tree Plugin, Writing a New Controller Plugin, Writing a New Planner Plugin, Writing a New Behavior Plugin, or Writing a New Navigator Plugin.

### Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer

https://github.com/SteveMacenski/spatio_temporal_voxel_layer/tree/humble

This is a drop in replacement for the voxel_grid voxel representation of the environment. This package does a number of things to improve on the voxel grid package and extend the capabilities offered to the users, under a LGPL v2.1 license. Developed and maintained by Steven Macenski at Simbe Robotics.

MecanumWheelBot uses

In this example, we illustrate key concepts of the ros2_control framework, particularly the controller manager, asynchronous controllers, and asynchronous hardware interfaces. MecanumWheelBot is a simple mobile base using 4 mecanum wheels.

Find the documentation in doc/userdoc.rst or on control.ros.org.
