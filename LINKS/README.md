### ndt_omp

https://github.com/dfki-ric/pclomp

Multi-threaded and SSE friendly NDT algorithm

This package provides an OpenMP-boosted Normal Distributions Transform (and GICP) algorithm derived from pcl. The NDT algorithm is modified to be SSE-friendly and multi-threaded. It can run up to 10 times faster than its original version in pcl.

### mycobot_ros2
OS ROS_2

This repository contains ROS 2 packages for simulating and controlling the myCobot robotic arm using ROS 2 Control and MoveIt 2. It provides support for Gazebo simulation and visualization in RViz. Gazebo simulation also includes simulated 3D point cloud data from the depth camera (RGBD) sensor plugin for vision.
